- Use Authenication to midigate the hassle
	- Potential to later implement Google authentification or other such options
- Storage handling - if we decide to store images online (Maybe for future feature or something) we can use Storage Buckets 
- Automatic-Back-Up: Only possible using a paid plan.
		- Not feasible for this project
- Realtime / live-sync functionality: you can subscribe to database changes to power live collaborative features or real-time updates.
- Optionally, serverless edge functions (aka. backend code running close to user, no need to run own servers) if your app needs custom logic.
